# Astar Algorithm
# BFS Algorithm
# IDDFS Algorithm

Assignment: using any size puzzle ex. 3x3, 4x4, 5x5,... numbered from 1 -> max size. Lets say we have a 3x3 puzzle, then it will have 8 filled in spots at random with numbers between 1-8 (no repeats). The max size will be represented as our x so for a 3x3 let x = 9. This x is located somewhere at random in the puzzle and we will re arrange the numbers in the puzzle in numerical order moving each tile around. I will solve the problem with Astar, BFS, and IDDFS.  

In the repository I will post my writeup which explains the efficiency and when to use which algorithm.

The program will check if a solution exists.
